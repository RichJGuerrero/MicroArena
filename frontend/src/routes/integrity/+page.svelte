      <h2>What Is Integrity?</h2>
      <p>
        Integrity is your competitive reputation across MicroArena.
        It reflects how you and your teammates conduct yourselves in matches,
        disputes, and tournaments.

      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Integrity is earned through clean, undisputed matches.</li>
        <li>Repeated disputes, rule violations, or bad conduct may lower integrity.</li>
        <li>Integrity applies to both individual players and clans.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Competitive platforms fail when cheaters and bad actors face no consequences.
        Integrity allows MicroArena to reward fair play without relying on automation
        or invasive systems.

      <h2>Human-First Enforcement</h2>
      <p>
        MicroArena does not use automated anti-cheat or game-level detection.
        Integrity decisions are based on human review, evidence, and context.
